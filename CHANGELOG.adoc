==== Journal format changes

This release has Phase 1 support for new Journal Format Version v2.
This means that it will accept both old deprecated
link:https://tackler.e257.fi/docs/journal/format/v1/[version v1]
and new link:https://tackler.e257.fi/docs/journal/format/v2/[version v2]
of journal format. All exports
(link:https://tackler.e257.fi/docs/export-equity/[Equity] and
link:https://tackler.e257.fi/docs/export-identity/[Identity])
are in new format.

Phase 1 support for Journal Format Version v2

 * Txn description can start with `'` (this is mandatory with v2)
 * Txn Metadata (UUID) can start with `#` (this is mandatory with v2)
 * Txn code can still have `'` `(` `)` `[` `]` `{` `}` `<` `>` characters (these are not allowed with v2)

 * link:https://tackler.e257.fi/docs/export-identity/[Identity] and
 link:https://tackler.e257.fi/docs/export-equity/[Equity]
 will output only format v2 compatible exports

===== Future Journal format v2

Future version of Tackler journal v2 will have following changes:

Transaction description::
Transaction description must start with `'` -prefix.


Transaction code::
Transaction code can not contain characters: +
`'` `(` `)` `[` `]` `{` `}` `<` `>`

Transaction metadata::
Transaction metadata (UUID) must start with `#` + space -prefix.

See xref:./docs/tep/tep-1009.adoc[TEP-1009: Txn Header Syntax]
for motivation for this change and for further info.

 * Support Account Auditing, see:
 ** xref:./docs/auditing.adoc[Accounting Auditing and Asssurance]
 ** xref:./docs/tep/tep-1007.adoc[TEP-1007: Txn Set Checksum]
 ** xref:./docs/tackler.conf[tackler.conf]
 * New or changed Metadata:
 ** Renamed Metadata's `metadataItems` to `items`
 ** New item: `TxnSetChecksum`
 ** New item: `AccountSelectorChecksum`
 ** New fields in `GitInputReference`
 *** Fields: `input.git.dir` and `input.git.suffix`
 ** Renamed `TxnFilterMetadata` -> `TxnFilterDescription`

Reject invalid UUIDs which were permitted in the past. These are certain 
way invalid and malformed UUIDs, which are accepted by JDK.

This could change old valid journal to invalid, if journal contains 
these special way invalid UUIDs.
