= Building Tackler

Tackler build is done by link:http://www.scala-sbt.org/[sbt].


== Building and testing

 sbt clean test


== Generating binaries

 sbt cli/assembly


== Code coverage

 sbt clean coveraOn test coverateReport
 sbt coverageAggregate


== IntelliJ

If IntelliJ can not compile e.g. unit tests, make sure that under settings 
for all subprojects (`tackler`, `cli`, `core`) compile order is `java then scala`.

Easiest way to generate parser definition is run `sbt compile`.
You can also install ANTLR plugin, but it must be configured correctly for package-names
and output paths.


== ANTLR

IntelliJ ANTLR plugin has really nice graphical tree display to visualize and test parser rules.
