= Building Tackler


Tackler build is done by link:http://www.scala-sbt.org/[sbt].

== Source code

Tackler source code is located at
link:https://gitlab.com/e257/accounting/tackler[GitLab / E257 / Accounting / Tackler]


== Building and testing

----
LC_ALL=C.UTF-8 sbt clean compile
----

=== Running tests

----
LC_ALL=C.UTF-8 sbt test it:test
----

Some of the integration tests generate lots of output or take several minutes run.

Especially `cli/it:test` generates lots of output and `core/it:test` takes few minutes to run.

It might be helpful to run tests selectively, especially in case of errors:

Start `LC_ALL=C.UTF-8 sbt` and run on sbt shell:

....
> apiJVM/test
> core/test
> cli/test
....


==== Running integration tests

You could run integration tests all at once (`core/it:test`, `cli/it:test`)
or by step-by-step. `core/it:test` contains some performance tests.

----
> core/it:test
> cli/it:test
# or select wanted Dirsuite
> cli/it:testOnly fi.e257.tackler.cli.Dirsuite...
----


== Generating binaries

----
sbt cli/assembly
----

== Code coverage

----
LC_ALL=C.UTF-8 sbt clean coverage test it:test && sbt coverageAggregate
----

== IntelliJ

If IntelliJ can not compile e.g. unit tests, make sure that under settings 
for all subprojects (`tackler`, `cli`, `core`) compile order is `java then scala`.

Easiest way to generate parser definition is run `sbt compile`.
You can also install ANTLR plugin, but it must be configured correctly for package-names
and output paths.


== ANTLR

IntelliJ ANTLR plugin has really nice graphical tree display to visualize and test parser rules.
