= Technical notes about GIT


`Repository implements AutoCloseable`

----
 The thread-safety of a {@link org.eclipse.jgit.lib.Repository} very much
 depends on the concrete implementation.

 * <li>{@code FileRepository} is thread-safe.
----

`RevWalk implements Iterable<RevCommit>, AutoCloseable`

----
 * RevWalk instances are not thread-safe. Applications must either restrict
 * usage of a RevWalk instance to a single thread, or implement their own
 * synchronization at a higher level.
----

`RevTree extends RevObject`

`RevObject extends ObjectIdOwnerMap.Entry`


`TreeWalk implements AutoCloseable, AttributesProvider`

----
 * Walks one or more {@link org.eclipse.jgit.treewalk.AbstractTreeIterator}s in
 * parallel.
 * <p>
 * This class can perform n-way differences across as many trees as necessary.
 * <p>
 * Each tree added must have the same root as existing trees in the walk.
 * <p>
 * A TreeWalk instance can only be used once to generate results. Running a
 * second time requires creating a new TreeWalk instance, or invoking
 * {@link #reset()} and adding new trees before starting again. Resetting an
 * existing instance may be faster for some applications as some internal
 * buffers may be recycled.
 * <p>
 * TreeWalk instances are not thread-safe. Applications must either restrict
 * usage of a TreeWalk instance to a single thread, or implement their own
 * synchronization at a higher level.
 * <p>
 * Multiple simultaneous TreeWalk instances per
 * {@link org.eclipse.jgit.lib.Repository} are permitted, even from concurrent
 * threads.

`abstract ObjectStream openStream()`
----
	 * Obtain an input stream to read this object's data.
	 *
	 * @return a stream of this object's data. Caller must close the stream when
	 *         through with it. The returned stream is buffered with a
	 *         reasonable buffer size.
----

`class ObjectStream extends InputStream `

`InputStream implements Closeable {`
