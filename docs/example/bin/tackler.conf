# Default time zone
#
# Timezone is used if Txn timestamp does not have zone info.
#
# Format is either zone's offset or ZoneID (IANA Time Zone Database),
# for example: "Z", "GMT", "UTC", "+02:00", "Europe/Helsinki"
#
# If timezone is offset, then timestamp is not adjusted based on
# daylight saving time.
#
# If timezone is zone name, then it is adjusted according
# the DST rules for that zone.
#
# timezone = "+02:00"
