----
| Transaction's content (comments and account postings) must be intented at least by one space. 

There must be two or more accounts (postings) which
must have zero sum if all accounts have amount. Account's amount can not be zero.

| At the moment only supported metadata is `uuid` which is reserved for optional transaction's
unique identifier (link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier[UUID]).

By Tackler's design constraints input order of transactions is not important.

Transactions are sorted by using txn-components in following order to find sort order
(in case of previous components have produced "same" sort order):

 timestamp, code, description, uuid

Transactions must have UUIDs, if fully deterministic, stable
and "distributed transaction producers"-safe sort order is needed.
