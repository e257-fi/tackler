= Register report

Register report is report with running total of transactions

On left amount column, there is posting amount and on right running total for that account.
Register report is good way to find oddities and anomalies withing accounting data.

By Tackler's design constraints input order of transactions is not important.
So there should be a stable way to sort transactions if
internal order of register report (e.g. order of txns during one day and without time information)
is important.  In that case it is mandatory to provide  unique sorting information for each transaction.

Transactions are sorted by using txn-components in following order to find sort order
(in case of previous components have produced "same" sort order):

 timestamp, code, description, uuid

Transactions must have UUIDs, if fully deterministic, stable
and "distributed transaction producers"-safe sort order is needed.

Currently register report prints each transaction's time with date resolution,
but this will change in future (there will be an option to control register report's
time resolution).


== Register report configuration

See link:tackler.conf[tackler.conf] and `reports.register.*` for full
information of register report configuration options.

=== Account filtering

Accounts for Register report can be filtered with global
`reporting.accounts` (conf+cli) or report specific `reports.register.accounts`
setting (conf-only).

If there are no accounts matched with selected regexs with some transaction,
then that transaction is not is not printed / outputted at all.
