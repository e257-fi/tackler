For user documentation please see link:../../commodities.adoc[Commodities].


== Special notes

If using price database with certain commodities, then price should be used
from latest value from history (based on transaction date),
and not in future or current value.

For example, this could be case with Helium, as gas price fluctuates
and used price should be as it was when gas was used.
Initially that could be manual operation.
