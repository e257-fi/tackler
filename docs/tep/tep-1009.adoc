= TEP-1009: Transaction Header Syntax

Change Transaction header format so that it is more robust, regular 
and less error prone for humans to manipulate.

Currently Tackler's format tries to mimic Ledger's format, and be as much 
compatible with as possible. However, ledger's journal format is somewhat fuzzy,
and it is unnecessarily difficult to detect some error cases.

For example, currently following invalid ISO-8601 offset (one extra space)
is recognized as start of txn description, not as an offset.

....

Same goes on with various not-so-obvious format errors with code field.
These are easy to handle with automatically generated transactions, but
for humans these are really confusing and error prone.

It doesn't help, that Tackler won't notice these as an error.


== Solution

Break compatibility with Ledger as needed, and change the grammar to more regular
and less error prone version.

This will cause that there will be following changes to journal format,
which are partially  incompatible (breaking change) with old journal format and data.


Transaction description::

Transaction description must start with `'` -prefix. This is breaking change to journal format.


Transaction code::

Transaction code can not contain characters: +
`'` `(` `)` `[` `]` `{` `}` `<` `>` +
This is breaking change to journal format, if these characters are used in code field.


Transaction metadata::

Transaction medadata must start with `#` -prefix, old `;:` -prefix will be deprecated.
