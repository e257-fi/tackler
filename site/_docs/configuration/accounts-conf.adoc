# Accounts and commodity related settings
accounts {

  # Strict account and commodity name validation mode
  #
  # If set true, then Tackler will process only accounts
  # which are listed on Chart of Accounts (accounts.coa).
  # It is fatal error if account is not listed in CoA,
  # and strict is same time set to be true.
  #
  # Same applies for commodities (see below).
  #
  # Valid values are (boolean): true, false
  # CLI: --accounts.strict
  strict = true

  # Permit empty or missing units and commodities
  #
  # This option is used only when accounts.strict is true
  #
  # Default is false, which means that all postings
  # must have commodity or unit. To allow posting without
  # commodity, set this to true or disable strict mode.
  #
  # Valid values are (boolean): true, false
  permit-empty-commodity = true

  # Chart of Accounts
  #
  # This is a list of known account names.
  #
  # Names must be quoted ("name")
  # and they are comma separated.
  #
  # Account names have following form:
  #
  #    TOPACCT[:SUBACCT[:...]]
  #
  # Top-account name (ID) must start with character,
  # and after that there could be
  # '_', '-', '·', numbers and characters.
  #
  # Sub-account name (SUBID) must be separated with ':',
  # can start with numbers and can be all numeric.
  #
  # Characters can be a wide range of
  # international UTF-8 characters.
  #
  # See https://tackler.e257.fi/docs/journal/charsets/ for full list.
