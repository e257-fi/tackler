This document has configuration examples of tackler for real life use.

== Example of Production Setup

This setup has two main features:

* Setup is done so that it is using version control for the setup itself and also for permanent journal data.

* Tackler is configured so that it is possible swicth back and forth between journal on filesystem
and journal data stored on version control.

The first version control setup (auxiliary repository) contains all tools, scripts
and documentation how to use and interpreter journal, for example description of Chart of Accounts, etc.

The second version control setup (journal) contains all accounting data and all accounting related settings.
Accounting data and settings (Chart of Accounts, report configurations) should be kept in same repository,
so that both will evolve in sync over time, and it should be possible to re-run reports from past.

Backend, which is used normally for daily operations, can be either filesystem or git based,
and it is possible to switch between backends by command line argument.


=== Directory and Version Control Structure

[source,sh]

----

Journal data must not be included into auxiliary repository
so it should be ignored on `books`-repository.

[source,sh]
.Content of `books/.gitignore`
----
# git-ignore for auxiliary books-repository
/dist/
/journal/
----

Tackler has an auto discovery mechanism for configuration and it can be used to point
tackler to the real configuration under journal.

[source,hocon]
.Content of `books/dist/tackler.conf`
----
# Tackler's jar file location is parent path for the include directive,
# e.g. dist-folder in this setup. It could also be an absolute path.
include required("../journal/conf/tackler.conf")
----

If above configuration auto discovery method is not used, then path to configuration file must be provided
with `--cfg` command line option.


=== Backend configuration: filesystem or Git

With this setup it is possible to use either filesystem or git backend at the same time.

Switching between backends can be done on the fly with CLI option:

- Filesystem (if default is git): `--input.storage=fs`
- Git backend (if default is fs): `--input.storage=git`

.Configuration setup for filesystem and git backends at the same time
[source,hocon]
----
tackler {
  core {
    # Relative or absolute path to journal-folder
    # If this is relative path, then parent path is determined
    # based on tackler's jar-file location (e.g. dist-folder in this setup)
    basedir = ../journal

    input {
      # This is the default backend, which is used when tackler is
      # called without any storage options.
      # Valid values are: fs | git
      storage = fs

      fs {
        dir = txns/
        glob = "**.txn"
      }

      git {
        # This is local path of GIT repository for journal data,
        # e.g. internal git-data of local clone (used for reading)
        repository = .git
        # Name of main branch, e.g. "Y2020", "main", "master", etc.
        ref = "master"
        # This path is inside *repository*, e.g. path directly under ref's root
        dir = txns/
        suffix = ".txn"
      }
    }
    include required("./accounts.conf")
    include required("./tags.conf")
  }
}
----

== Configuration with environment variables

Configuration system
(link:https://github.com/typesafehub/config/blob/master/HOCON.md[Typesafe Config])
used by Tackler supports using  environment variables as part of configuration.

Below is an example how to use those for setting shard for report and selecting
xref:../report-balance-group.adoc[Balance-Group]'s title and groupBy operator.

[source,hocon]
.tackler.conf with environment variables
----
tackler {
  core {
    basedir = ../journal

    input {
      storage = fs

      fs {
        dir = txns/${?TXN_SHARD}
        glob = "**.txn"
      }

      git {
        repository = .git
        ref = "master"
        dir = txns/${?TXN_SHARD}
        suffix = ".txn"
      }
    }

    reporting {
      reports = [ "balance", "balance-group" ]

      accounts = [
        "Expenses(:.*)?",
        ]
    }

    reports {
      balance-group {
        title = ${?BALGRP_TITLE}
        group-by = ${?BALGRP_GROUPBY}
      }
    }

    include required("./accounts.conf")
    include required("./tags.conf")
  }
}
