Tackler configuration is controlled by configuration files and command line options.

== Reference configuration and examples

* Reference configuration file, xref:./configuration/tackler-conf.adoc[tackler.conf]
* Account name rules and example account, xref:./configuration/accounts-conf.adoc[accounts.conf]
* Examples for production systems, xref:./configuration/examples.adoc[Configuration Examples]


== Configuration discovery

If path to external configuration file is not provided with `--cfg` option,
then Tackler will seek file named as  `tackler.conf` next to the location of jar-file.
If there is any, then this will be used as an external configuration.

=== Merging configurations to active set

Tackler will create an active configuration in following way:

* Baseline is embedded default config
* Then external configuration, if there is any,  is applied
* Lastly some cmd-line args can be used to override current configuration

All config's are merged together,
and the last defined value is what is used
by configuration (e.g. if there are any cmd-line arguments).
