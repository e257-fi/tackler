Full reference of Tackler configuration. All settings have defaults 
values, and only those which would be overridden should be defined.

See xref:./accounts-conf.adoc[accounts.conf] for accounts configuration
and xref:./tags-conf.adoc[tags.conf] for defining transaction tags.

Examples of production setups are under xref:./examples.adoc[example configurations] section.

[NOTE]
====
Relative basedir-paths are always relative to the used cfg-file.

* External conf-file, then it is conf-file's directory.
* Embedded conf-file, then it is directory where executed jar is located.

[NOTE]
====
Some of the configuration settings can be overridden with CLI options.
