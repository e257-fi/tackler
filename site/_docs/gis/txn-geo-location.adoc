Tackler supports `location` metadata with transaction data and this makes it possible to record
location data for that transaction.  This location data could be used later to select transaction
for reports or plot transactions on map. link:/docs/gis/#use-cases[Plaintext accounting with GIS]
has ideas for some use cases.

See xref:txn-geo-filters.adoc[Transaction Geo Filters]
for information how to select transactions based on location data
and xref:example.adoc[Travel Journal with Geo Location] for full example of GIS data and reports.


== Geo Location Syntax

Transaction location is recorded by using `location` metadata field, and actual location is provided by geo URI.

Supported geo URI scheme is simplified version of link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5870[RFC 5870]:

* Only coordinates (lat, lon, and alt) are supported
* Only supported Coordinate Reference System is WGS84 (EPSG:4326).
* Any of `p` (parameters) part of
link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5870#section-3.3[geo URI scheme]
is not accepted at all, including `u`,
and none of these can be present with location field's value.
