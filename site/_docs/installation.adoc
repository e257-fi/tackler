This is installation manual for tackler command line.

To use tackler cli you will need

  * Java Runtime Environment (Java 8 and Java 11 are tested regularly)
  * Tackler command line binary (`tackler-cli.jar`-file)

Download the latest version of tackler-cli.jar from
{jarlink}[here] or
https://gitlab.com/e257/accounting/tackler/blob/main/docs/devel/build.adoc[build it yourself].


== Minimal setup

Minimal initial installation and setup is described in xref:quickstart.adoc[Quickstart Guide].

Tackler could be used with minimal quickstart setup just fine, but to get most out of it (strict modes, git storage system, Audit trail functinality etc.), it must be configured properly. Below is recommended setup for production use.

== Recommended Setup and layout

Recommended layout and setup (the "installation") would be:

----
.
├── bin
│   ├── tackler-cli.jar
│   └── tackler.conf
└── journal
    ├── conf
    │   ├── accounts.conf
    │   ├── tackler.conf
    │   └── tags.conf
    └── txns
        ├── ...
        ├── 2020
        │   ├── ...
        │   └── 12
        │       ├── journal-1.txn
        │       └── journal-2.txn
        └── 2021
            └── 01
                ├── journal-1.txn
                └── journal-2.txn
----

This setup uses year/month based sharding for transactions (the directory structure under `txns`).  It's up to for each
system to decide which is xref:./journal/sharding.adoc[the best way to shard transaction data], or not to shard transactions at all.


=== Configuration Settings for Recommended Layout

By default Tackler will try to find configuration file (`tackler.conf`) next to its jar-file. It's also possible to provide path to configuration with `--cfg` option, if you don't like to use auto discovery functionality or would like to e.g. use several different configuration files.

==== tackler.conf

.bin/tackler.conf
----
include required("../journal/conf/tackler.conf")
----

Actual configuration is located under journal:

.journal/conf/tackler.conf
----
tackler {
  core {
    basedir = ../journal
    input {
      storage = fs
      fs {
        dir = "txns"
        glob = "**.txn"
      }
    }
    include required("./accounts.conf")
    include required("./tags.conf")
  }
}
----

This setup makes it possible to separate journal setup and data, and store relevant configuration next to transaction data (and possibly under version control).

See xref:./configuration/examples.adoc#backend-fs-or-git[Configuration Example: fs or git] how combine git based transaction storage with this setup.


==== accounts.conf

If there is missing or mistyped account, that will cause an error and tackler will stop processing journal.
See xref:./configuration/accounts-conf.adoc[accounts.conf] for full documentation
of Chart of Accounts and commodity listing.

.journal/conf/accounts.conf
[source,sh]
----
accounts {

  strict = true

  permit-empty-commodity = true

  chart-of-accounts = [
    "Expenses:Ice_cream",
    "Expenses:Lemonade",
    "Assets:Cash"
  ]
}
----

==== tags.conf

If there is missing or mistyped tag, that will cause an error and tackler will stop processing journal.
See xref:./configuration/tags-conf.adoc[tags.conf] for full documentation
of Chart of Tags.

.journal/conf/tags.conf
[source,sh]
----
tags {
   strict = true

   chart-of-tags = [
      "travel:ice·cream·spree",
   ]
}
----

With this setup, it is possible to run Tackler by:

 java -jar ./bin/tackler-cli.jar

and it will just work.
