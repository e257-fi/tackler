= Journal Format
:page-layout: page
:page-redirect_from: /docs/journal/format/v2/

Tacklers journal is based on idea of link:https://plaintextaccounting.org/[plain text files], 
where each accounting record is written in human readable and editable form into those text files. 
This idea of text based double-entry accounting was 
link:https://www.ledger-cli.org/[invented and pioneered] by John Wiegley in 2003.

[NOTE]
Tackler Ain't Calculator and Kernel for link:http://ledger-cli.org/[Ledger] Equivalent Records. + 
Why not? Because it uses simplified syntax.

== Journal files

Journal can be a single file or it can be split on transaction level into multiple files (shards).

See general link:/docs/journal/[Journal Documentation], 
xref:../usage.adoc[Usage Manual] and 
xref:../tackler-conf.adoc[tackler.conf] for further defails
how to define used storage system and ideas for different sharding schemes.


== Journal Format Syntax

[NOTE]
.New Journal Format Version v2
====

[horizontal]
Transaction description:: in v2, description must start with `'` -prefix

Transaction code:: in v2, code can not contain  `'` `(` `)` `[` `]` `{` `}` `<` `>` characters

Transaction metadata (uuid):: in v2, metadata must start by ``#`` character with space
====

Tackler v0.24.0 has Phase 1 support for new Journal Format Version v2.
This means that it will accept both old deprecated xref:./format/v1.adoc[version v1]
and new version v2 of journal format. All exports
(xref:../export-equity.adoc[Equity] and xref:../export-identity.adoc[Identity])
are in new format.

[WARNING]

| This is sequence of Transactions (Txns). There could one
or many Txns per input file.

See xref:./sharding.adoc[Transaction data sharding] for ideas
how to store journal.

| Basic transaction

----
DATE [CODE] [DESCRIPTION]
 ACCOUNT  AMOUNT
 ACCOUNT  [AMOUNT]
----
| Transaction's content (comments and account postings) must be intented at least by *one* space. 

There must be two or more accounts (postings) which
must have zero sum if all accounts have amount. Account's amount can not be zero.

Amount of *last* account could be omitted, in that case it will be 
calculated automatically.

There has to be at least one space between account and amount.
If compatibility with other systems is needed, then two spaces should be used.

Output truncation:
  1.123456701 is printed as
  1.1234567   with scale.max=7

  1.12345675  is rounded (HALF_UP) as
  1.1234568   with scale.max=7
----

Default *output* scale is is between 2..7 decimal points.  This is can be configured 
by `reporting.scale.{min, max}` in xref:../tackler-conf.adoc[tackler.conf].

Tackler uses decimal floating-point numbers of arbitrary precision (Scala BigDecimals) for calculations.
By default, the precision approximately matches that of IEEE 128-bit floating point numbers (34 decimal digits).
