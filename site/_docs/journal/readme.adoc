Tackler supports journals on plain filesystem and on git repository.

Tackler can use journal from single file or journal could be split into multiple different files. 
There are options to configure directory setup from where tackler will scan journal files.

See xref:./journal/sharding.adoc[Transaction data sharding] for information of possible ways to 
shard transaction data, and xref:./journal/format.adoc[Journal Format] for description of journal syntax.


== Git storage

Tackler has native, integrated support for Git. This means that journal data 
is read directly from git and for that reason all Git's reference notations
are supported: branches, tags, symbolic version selectors and 
plain commit ids.

This also means that State of Journal is extremely well defined
and reported  when Git storage is used.
There won't be any fuzz if working copy was in clean state or not, 
because used journal is always in committed state.
Tackler also includes used commit id  into reports.

For full details and examples, 
see xref:./journal/git-storage.adoc[Git Storage Manual]
and xref:./auditing.adoc[Accounting Auditing], 


== Filesystem storage

Journal is read directly from filesystem storage as plain file or set of files, 
when filesystem storage is used. See xref:./installation.adoc[Installation Manual] 
for further info.
