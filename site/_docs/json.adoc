JSON is treated as Human Machine Interface, e.g. values etc.
are truncated the same way as with text output, and all data is represented 
as strings.

This means reports in JSON format should be ready to be displayed
to user by UI as they are without further processing or data formatting.

JSON output does not contain null values, e.g. if field is null, it is dropped.

xref:./client-api.adoc[Client API] lists used data models for JSON serialization.

== Example reports

Supported reports with JSON output are `balance`, `balance-group` and `register`.
Exports in Tackler journal format (`equity` and `identity`) are not supported with JSON.
