Balance Group report is combined report of multiple balance reports 
which are done out of sets of transactions.

There are several different operators to select how transaction sets are formed.

Available group operators are:
`year`, `month`, `day`, `iso-week` and `iso-week-date`.

link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date[ISO-8601 week date] rules are used 
for `iso-week` and `iso-week-date`.

Balance-group report provides handy way to produce subreports over reporting period, 
for example there could be need of weekly subreports for each monthly reporting period.

== Format
Output format of Balance-group report is same as balance report, 
except that there are multiple subset balances included into same report.

First (the leftmost) sum is sum of postings which are directly debiting or crediting 
that account (account tree node). If there are no such transactions,  then this first sum is zero.

Second sum is recursive balance sum for that account tree (account and all its sub-accounts).

The sum reported under line is balance delta, e.g. value difference of reported accounts.

[NOTE]
Balance delta is based and calculated only by values reported on the first column.


== Balance group report configuration


Balance Groups are selected by `reports.balance-group.group-by` conf-setting.

See xref:./tackler-conf.adoc[tackler.conf] and `reports.balance-group.*` for full
information of balance group report configuration options.


=== Account selectors

By default all accounts are included into balance-Group report, but that's not very
interesting balance group report because balance over all accounts will be zero always.

Balance-Group report accounts can be selected by Accounts Selectors. This can be done
either by using global `reporting.accounts` (conf+cli) option or by using report specific
`reports.balance-group.accounts` setting (conf-only). If report specific account selector
is defined in configuration, it can not be overridden from command line.

[NOTE]
====
If there are no accounts selected within some balance group time period,
then that balance group is not is not reported (e.g. not included into reports).
====

Balance delta is based and calculated only by values reported on the first column.
This means that if sub-account is not listed by balance-group report,
it will *not* be part of balance calculations.

[WARNING]
====
If Accounts Selector is used balance-group report, please be make sure that all intended accounts
and especially *sub-accounts* are listed for report. +
 +
For example: select only top-level "Assets" and all its sub-accounts: `"Assets(:.*)?"`
====

Compare following two reports:

.`--reporting.accounts "e1(:.*)?"`

=== Example output of balance-group report

Below is part of performance test output.
Time span of Transaction set is one year, and each balance group is calculated
by week (iso-8601 weeks with UTC timezone 'Z'). 

In the report `em01` is monthly-day based expence account, and "am01" is monthly based
assets account. For that reason, "e:ey2016:em01:ed01" and "e:ey2016:em01:ed02"  have
transactions on week 2016-W01 and "e:ey2016:em01:ed03, ..." on week 2016-W02.
