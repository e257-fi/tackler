Balance report is sum of selected accounts and sub-accounts.

....
BALANCE
-------
                 0.00   -2.00  Assets
                -2.00   -2.00  Assets:Cash
                 0.00    2.00  Expenses
                 2.00    2.00  Expenses:Ice_cream
=====================
                 0.00

== Format

First (the leftmost) sum is sum of postings which are directly debiting or crediting 
that account (account tree node). If there are no such transactions,  then this first sum is zero.

Second sum is recursive balance sum for that account tree (account and all its sub-accounts).

The sum reported under line is balance delta, e.g. value difference of reported accounts.

[NOTE]
====
Balance delta is based and calculated only by values reported on the first column.
====


== Balance report configuration

See xref:./configuration/tackler-conf.adoc[tackler.conf] and `reports.balance.*` for full
information of balance report configuration options.


=== Account selectors

By default all accounts are included into balance report, but that's not very
interesting balance report because balance over all accounts will be zero always.

Balance report accounts can be selected by Accounts Selectors. This can be done
either by using global `reporting.accounts` (conf+cli) option or by using report specific
`reports.balance.accounts` setting (conf-only). If report specific account selector
is defined in configuration, it can not be overridden from command line.

Balance delta is based and calculated only by values reported on the first column.
This means that if sub-account is not listed by balance report,
it will *not* be part of balance calculations.

[WARNING]
====
If Accounts Selector is used balance report, please be make sure that all intended accounts
and especially *sub-accounts* are listed for report. +
 +
For example: select only top-level "Assets" and all its sub-accounts: `"Assets(:.*)?"`
====

Compare following two reports:

.`--reporting.accounts "e1(:.*)?"`
----
BALANCE
-------
                 1.00    6.00  e1
                 2.00    5.00  e1:e2
                 3.00    3.00  e1:e2:e3
=====================
                 6.00
----

.`--reporting.accounts "e1"`
----
BALANCE
-------
                 1.00    6.00  e1
=====================
                 1.00
----

These two reports demonstrates difference between balance delta and
recursive balance sum for specific account tree.
