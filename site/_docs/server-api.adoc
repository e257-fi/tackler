This document explains how to embedded Tackler core and use it as a library in other systems.

Tackler operates on stream of immutable transactions and over this
transaction stream (or sub-selection of it) it generates different reports.

Transaction stream is immutable and thread safe, and it is possible to make multiple reports
over same set of txn data. Currently all transactions are held in memory.

Dependency settings for SBT are:

    libraryDependencies += "fi.e257" %%  "tackler-core" % "version-number"

This is released on Maven Central Repository.


== Reading transactions

Transactions can be read from three different sources

 * From filesystem `fs`-storage xref:./tackler-conf.adoc[(conf: tackler.core.input.fs)]
 * From xref:./git-storage.adoc[Git] `git`-storage xref:./tackler-conf.adoc[(conf: tackler.core.input.git)]
 * Internally directly from string

All of these inputs produce transaction stream and metadata of that stream. This transaction set (`txnData`)
can then be fed to different reports.  See
{gitlink}/core/src/main/scala/fi/e257/tackler/parser/TacklerTxns.scala[core -> main -> parser -> TacklerTxns]
and it's companion object's helpers.

== Filtering transactions

There is an option to filter transactions based on attributes of single transaction.
See xref:./txn-filters.adoc[Transaction Filters] for general information about these filters.

Transaction filter models are defined at
{gitlink}/api/src/main/scala/fi/e257/tackler/api/TxnFilter.scala[api -> TxnFilter].
Actual filtering implementation is located in package:
{gitlink}/core/src/main/scala/fi/e257/tackler/filter/[core -> filter].

Filters are typically used via
{gitlink}/core/src/main/scala/fi/e257/tackler/model/TxnData.scala[core -> model -> TxnData.filter] method.
See {gitlink}/core/src/test/scala/fi/e257/tackler/filter/[core -> test -> filter]
for examples of how to define and use transaction filters.


=== JSON decoding of transaction filters

Server API provides JSON decoding of transaction filters
via link:https://circe.github.io/circe/[Circe].

Below is an example of how filter can be created from JSON string:

----
import io.circe.parser.decode
import fi.e257.tackler.api.TxnFilterDefinition

val filterJsonStr = """{ "txnFilter": { "TxnFilterTxnCode" : { "regex" : "#123" } } }"""

val txnFilterDef = decode[TxnFilterDefinition](filterJsonStr)

// txnFilterDef: Either[io.circe.Error,fi.e257.tackler.api.TxnFilterDefinition] = Right(TxnFilterDefinition(TxnFilterTxnCode(#123)))
----

See {gitlink}/core/src/test/scala/fi/e257/tackler/filter/TxnFilterJsonTest.scala[core -> test -> filter -> TxnFilterJsonTest]
for more examples of JSON decoding and encoding.

== Generating reports

Reports are done in three steps:

 1. Make settings for report (`BalanceSettings`)
 2. Instantiate report maker (`BalanceReporter`)
 3. Generate actual report (`balRpt.jsonReport(txnData)`)

=== Consuming reports

See xref:./client-api.adoc[Client API] how to use generated reports on client side.


== Example of usage of Server API

There is test for server reporting api, which could be used as an example.
With this test transactions are read internally from string, and then that txns stream is used to produce various
reports.

Tackler's CLI contains examples (`git2Txns` and `paths2Txns`) how to use FS or Git storage:
{gitlink}/cli/src/main/scala/fi/e257/tackler/cli/TacklerCli.scala[cli -> main -> TacklerCli]

Test cases for GIT input are located here:
{gitlink}/core/src/it/scala/fi/e257/tackler/parser/TacklerTxnsGitTest.scala[core -> it -> parser -> TacklerTxnsGitTest]

Complete test cases for Report API are located here:
{gitlink}/core/src/test/scala/fi/e257/tackler/report/ReportApiTest.scala[core -> test -> report -> ReportApiTest]
