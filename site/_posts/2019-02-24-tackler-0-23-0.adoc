== Fixes

Reject invalid UUIDs which were permitted in the past. There are certain 
way invalid and malformed UUIDs, which are accepted by JDK.

This could change old valid journal to invalid, if journal contains 
these specially way invalid UUIDs. 

See following openjdk bugs for details:

 * https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8159339
 * https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8165199
