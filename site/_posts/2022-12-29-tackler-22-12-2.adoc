== New features and changes in this release:

This is a re-release of Tackler CLI 22.12.1 with correct assembly packaging. No other changes.


=== Fixes

22.12.1 had broken logger functionality for tackler-cli.
The broken functionality is manifested by following error message:
....
SLF4J: No SLF4J providers were found.
SLF4J: Defaulting to no-operation (NOP) logger implementation
SLF4J: See https://www.slf4j.org/codes.html#noProviders for further details.
....

This release (22.12.2) fixes that.
