= Tackler Test Tracking Database (T3DB)

T3DB is Tackler's test tracking "database" for test coverage tracking.

Tackler Test Tracking Database tracks features and tests of those features 
and for error cases.

Main purpose of T3DB is to ensure all features are tested,
minimize amount of overlapping tests and prevent duplicate test cases.

T3DB also provides reverse mapping from test cases to features, which are tested 
by that particular test.
