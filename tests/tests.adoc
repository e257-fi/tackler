= Tackler Test Tracking Database (T3DB)

T3DB is Tackler's test tracking "database" for feature and test tracking.

Tackler Test Tracking Database tracks features and tests of those features.
Main purpose of T3DB is to ensure all features and error paths of those features
are tested and validated, minimize amount of overlapping tests and
prevent duplicate test cases.

T3DB also provides reverse mapping from test cases back to features which are validated
by that particular test case.
